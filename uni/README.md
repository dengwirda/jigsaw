## `UNIT-TESTS: various benchmarks for JIGSAW`

A set of unit tests designed to exercise various `JIGSAW`, `TRIPOD` and `MARCHE` functionality:

    * TEST2D_X.c: 2D Cartesian test cases, with X = {A, B, ..., etc}.
    * TEST3D_X.c: 3D Cartesian test cases, with X = {A, B, ..., etc}.
    * TEST2S_X.c: 2D Spherical test cases, with X = {A, B, ..., etc}.

See `JIGSAW`'s base `README` for build information via <a href="https://cmake.org/">`cmake`</a>.
